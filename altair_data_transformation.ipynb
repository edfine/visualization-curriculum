    "In previous notebooks we learned how to use marks and visual encodings to represent individual data records. Here we will explore methods for *transforming* data, including the use of aggregates to summarize multiple records. Data transformation is an integral part of visualization: choosing the  variables to show and their level of detail is just as important as choosing appropriate visual encodings. After all, it doesn't matter how well chosen your visual encodings are if you are showing the wrong information!\n",
